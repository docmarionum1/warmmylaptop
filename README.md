# Warm My Lap(top)

A stupid idea I had while working on a cold and rainy day from a shipping container which I needed to [keep open for WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage). 

## FAQ

1. What does this do?
    - A whole lotta nothing 
    
        `while (true) {}`
2. Is this bad for my laptop?
    - _It'll be fine_
3. Does this work on desktops?
    - Yes, but you'll need to put it on your lap.
